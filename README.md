#### Description

Hello, This is my final project for Cs50. This is Shortly. It is a simple frontend project, Where you can shorten links. I use the Javascript language and JS library named React, also some html in react and css. In this project I also use bitly API for url shortening. I made a simple and a good looking Navigation. In this web page you will see some logos with text. The main functionality of my web page is shortening links. It is well designed input with button. If the input is empty and If you click the button nothing will happen because of it. I tried some other API's and it didn't work, so i had to
find some other API's which would work, then I searched many API's and finally found a particular one, named bitly. I think it is a very good API, which provides us with short url's. Mostly in this project I use React. React is a Javascript library. I really like react, because everything in react is simple, user-friendly and easy-to-use. I also want to add that JSX is really cool and the built in state management is perfect for any beginner developer.

Why I am amazed for cs50? CS50 is really helpful for programmer's who need to further develop and deepen their knowlage in this profession.Also it is a great opportunity for them who want to learn programming deeply.It also gives a lot of experience to people like myself, which I really appreciate.

#### Skills That I use

- Html

- JS

- C

- Python

- Flask

- SQl

#### Things that I wanted to add in my web page

In the first place I am just finishing high school, so i had limited time to do everything that I wanted. If the situation was simpler and I had more free time than I currently have I would have definitely included these following features: login and registration. For this functionality I would have used a language like python and a python framework called flask.

#### Future plans

In first place I want to study in university, so if I want this to happen , I need to study well and write the exam and pass. Then I really want to start job as a junior front-end developer. To develop myself as a Full-stack Developer I want to learn Back-end development very well , In the first place I want to learn a Javascript back-end library called node.js.

#### Thank CS50

I really appreciate the opportunity, that you gave us. I really enjoyed taking the CS50 course , because It helped me to improve my skills as a software developer and become better computer programmer.

#### The End
